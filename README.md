CentOS 6 .spec for libevent 2.x.x
=================================

CentOS 6 contains libevent 1.x.x. Some software (for example,
rfc5766-turn-server) requires libevent > 2.0.0.

This project contains a .spec file (based on the one for Fedora) that builds and
packages libevent 2.x.x for CentOS 6.

Current version: 2.0.21
